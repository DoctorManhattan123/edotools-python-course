This task is about file inputs.

Solve the function one after another.

<div class="hint">
  Be aware of the correct flags

r - read only (default if no flag is given)

w - write permissions, creates file if non-existent and truncates it if it exists

a - write permissions, but without truncating the content

b - open in binary mode

There are more, but they should not be relevant for the tasks.
</div>
